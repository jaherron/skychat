# SkyChat

A proof of concept for chatting with Bluesky identities over the XMTP network.

***DISCLAIMER: THIS WAS VIBECODED WITH GITHUB COPILOT. This repo and app is intended to be a proof of concept, connected to the XMTP development network. Normally my apps contain mostly self-written code, but I used Copilot because I was not familiar with XMTP's SDK.***
