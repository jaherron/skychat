# SkyChat

A proof of concept for chatting with Bluesky identities over the XMTP network.

***DISCLAIMER: THIS WAS VIBECODED WITH GITHUB COPILOT. This repo and app is intended to be a proof of concept, connected to the XMTP development network. Normally my apps contain mostly self-written code, but I used Copilot because I was not familiar with XMTP's SDK.***

Thanks to [Shane](https://x.com/shanemac) and [Saul](https://x.com/saulcarlin) from XMTP Labs for chatting with me through the development of this app.

I may be contributing to the sentiment that ATProto is the **_SlopHaven Protocol._**
To be clear, I'm only OK with chatbots/coding. Not content (image/video) generation!
